## BinaryTree

- Super fast searching, one of the most used algorithams.
- Data is stored in nodes. (root -> left and right)
- 3 types of trees:
    - Full (tree with 0 or 2 children)
    - Perfect (all interior nodes have the same depth or level)
    - Balanced (tree with minimal possible hight)
- Key is used to represent a node.
